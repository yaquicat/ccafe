						<h2><a href="play.html">play</a></h2>
						<p>If you and your kids are itching to get out of the house then Circus Cafe is the place to go. This 8,500 square foot caf√© has two indoor play spaces-a soft-enclosed one for tots up to age two and a larger area for kids up to age six. The baby-friendly spot has rockers, blocks and other infant-and-toddler-friendly toys, while the preschooler area has a large wooden climber with a slide. There are also ride-on toys, a trampoline, an air hockey table and playhouses. If children prefer to curl up with a book, they can hang out on one of the comfy chairs. Circus Cafe has a full menu that features in-house-made goodies like pizza, soup, sandwiches, smoothies and of course, coffee. Admission is free for little ones up to eight months (with the purchase of a beverage) and $5.50 per child (plus $4.50 for each additional child).</p>
