						<p>In the center of Circus Café’s adorable and upscale 8,500 sq ft space is our 2,000 sq ft shoe-free play area designed especially for little ones 0-6 and enclosed behind a low wall. There are two entrances that are half doors that only open from the outside (to keep in would-be escapees). Along the low wall is a long counter where parents can sit and watch their kids play in a safe and clean play area while sipping a latte and enjoying our free Wi-Fi. You can also sit inside the play space as we'll have plenty of comfy seats.
​
						Featured in the play area is a bouncy house and a few other climb up/ slide down play structures so your little ones can get their wiggles out. Also a custom made play town including a café, a theater, a fire station and a train station stocked with coordinating imaginative and role playing toys and dress up costumes. There are lots of ride on toys where the kiddos can scoot around on our “road”.
​
						We also have a cozy baby/toddler play area situated under a beautiful “tree” and blocked off by an adorable white picket fence (that way, hopefully the little ones won't get run over by the bigger ones). Parents can relax on a sofa while their itty bitty ones crawl and learn to walk on the comfy rugs and play with quality age appropriate toys.</p>

						<p>Learning is a big part of what we are doing. Doctors and educators agree that children learn best through open ended play. Play is so important to optimal child development that it has been recognized by the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights as a right of every child.
​
						According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, play allows children to use their creativity while developing their imagination, dexterity, and physical, cognitive, and emotional strength. Play is important to healthy brain development. It is through play that children at a very early age engage and interact in the world around them. Play allows children to create and explore a world they can master, conquering their fears while practicing adult roles, sometimes in conjunction with other children or adult caregivers. As they master their world, play helps children develop new competencies that lead to enhanced confidence and the resiliency they will need to face future challenges.
​
						Undirected play allows children to learn how to work in groups, to share, to negotiate, to resolve conflicts, and to learn self-advocacy skills. When play is allowed to be child driven, children practice decision-making skills, move at their own pace, discover their own areas of interest, and ultimately engage fully in the passions they wish to pursue.
​
						Circus Café offers an ideal, safe and secure space for your child to play, learn and grow. We look forward to your visit and hope you'll make Circus Café a regular part of your child's play time.</p>
